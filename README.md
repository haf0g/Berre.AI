## Overview
The Berrechid City AI Chatbot Assistant is a web-based application that leverages natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to provide accurate and helpful responses to user queries about locations in Berrechid. The system uses a combination of **Sentence Transformers** for semantic search and **Groq's LLaMA 3 model** for generating natural language responses.

## Features
- **Location Search**: Retrieve information about places in Berrechid, including names, addresses, and details.
- **Semantic Search**: Find relevant locations based on user queries using cosine similarity.
- **Natural Language Responses**: Generate human-like responses using Groq's LLaMA 3 model.
- **Web Interface**: A user-friendly web interface for interacting with the chatbot.
- **Multi-language Support**: The chatbot can understand and respond in multiple languages.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Flask**: Web framework for building the application.
- **Sentence Transformers**: For generating embeddings and semantic search.
- **Groq API**: For generating natural language responses using the LLaMA 3 model.
- **Sklearn**: For calculating cosine similarity.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: For the front-end interface.
